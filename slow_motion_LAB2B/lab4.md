### LAB 04 ###

For this functionality the major difference from part 3 is increasing the time between each of the LED invocations. A simple delay condition is used in this implementation to effectively make the led burn brighter or dimmer based on the user defined macros. 

As a result of this, 2 modes were added to the previous implementation, 

1) 'f' : - To toggle the led fast. Passes throught the stored input fast.
2) 's' : - to toggle the led slow. Passes through the stored input slowly.
